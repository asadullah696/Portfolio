<b><abbr title="Islamic Republic Of Pakistan">Pakistan</abbr>,</b><sup><a href="www.google.com/">[c]</a></sup> officially the <strong>Islamic Republic Of Pakistan</strong>,<sup><a href="www.google.com/">[d]</a></sup> is a country in South Asia. It is
the fifth-most populous country in the world, with a population of 227 million, and has the <a href="www.google.com/">second-largest Muslim population</a> country in the world.
Pakistan is the <a href="www.google.com/">33rd-largest country by area</a>, spanning 881,913 square kilometres(340,509 square miles). it has a 1,046-kilometre (650-miles)
coastline along the <a href="www.google.com/">Arabian sea</a> and <a href="www.google.com/">Gulf of Oman</a> in the South, and is bodered by <a href="www.google.com/">India</a> to <a href="www.google.com/">the east,Afghanistan</a> to <a href="www.google.com/">the west,Iran</a> to <a href="www.google.com/">the southwest</a>,and <a href="www.google.com/">china</a> to
<a href="www.google.com/">the northeast</a>. It is separated narrowly from <a href="www.google.com/">Tajikstan</a> by Afghanistan's <a href="www.google.com/">wakhan Corridor</a> in the north , and also shares a maritime border with <a href="www.google.com/">Oman</a>. <br />

Pakistan is the site of <a href="www.google.com/">several ancient cultures</a>, including the 8,500-year-old <a href="www.google.com/">Neolithic</a> site of <a href="www.google.com/">Mehrgarh</a> in <a href="www.google.com/">Balochistan,<sup>[14]</a></sup> and the <a href="www.google.com/">Indus Valley Civilisation</a>
of the <a href="www.google.com/">Bronze Age,</a> the most extensive of the civilisations of the <a href="www.google.com/">Old World.<sup>[15]</a></sup> The region that comprises the modern state of Pakistan was the realm of multiple
empires and dynasties, including the <a href="www.google.com/">Achaemenid;</a> briefly that of <a href="www.google.com/">Alexandra the Great;</a> the <a href="www.google.com/">Seleucid,</a> the <a href="www.google.com/">Maurya,</a> the <a href="www.google.com/">Kushan,</a> the <a href="www.google.com/">Gupta;<sup>[16]</a></sup> the <a href="www.google.com/">Ummayad Caliphate</a>
in its southern region, the <a href="www.google.com/">Hindus Shahi,</a> the <a href="www.google.com/">Ghaznavids,</a> the <a href="www.google.com/">Delhi Sultanate,</a> the <a href="www.google.com/">Mughal<sup>[17]</a></sup>the <a href="www.google.com/">Durranis,</a> the <a href="www.google.com/">Sikh Empire, British East India Company rule,</a> and 
most recently, the <a href="www.google.com/">British Indian Empire</a> from 1858 to 1947. <br />

Spurred by the <a href="www.google.com/">Pakistan Movement,</a>which sought a homeland for the <a href="www.google.com/">Muslims</a> of <a href="www.google.com/">British India,</a> and election victories in 1946 by <a href="www.google.com/">All-India Muslim League,</a> Pakistan gained independence
in 1947 after the <a href="www.google.com/">Partition of the British Indian Empire</a>,which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions and was accompanied by an unparalleled mass migration and
loss of life.<sup><a href="www.google.com/">[18]</a></sup>Initially a <a href="www.google.com/">Dominion</a> of the <a href="www.google.com/">British Commonwealth,</a> Pakistan officially drafted <a href="www.google.com/">its constitution</a> in 1956, and emerged as a declared <a href="www.google.com/">Islamic Rebublic.</a>
In 1971, the exclave of <a href="www.google.com/">East Pakistan</a> seceded as the new country of <a href="www.google.com/">Bangladesh</a> after a <a href="www.google.com/">nine-month-long civil war.</a> In the following four decades, Pakistan has been ruled by governments
whose descriptions , althought complex, commonly alternated between civilian and military, democratic and authoritarian, relatively <a href="www.google.com/">secular</a> and <a href="www.google.com/">Islamist.<sup>[19]</a></sup> Pakistan
elected a civilian  government in 2008, and in 2010 adopted a <a href="www.google.com/">parliamentary system</a> with periodic elections.<sup><a href="www.google.com/">[20]</a></sup>
