=============

smart-buffer is a Buffer wrapper that adds automatic read & write offset tracking, string operations, data insertions, and more.

![stats](https://nodei.co/npm/smart-buffer.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true "stats")

**Key Features**:
* Proxies all of the Buffer write and read functions
* Keeps track of read and write offsets automatically
* Grows the internal Buffer as needed
* Useful string operations. (Null terminating strings)
* Allows for inserting values at specific points in the Buffer
* Built in TypeScript
* Type Definitions Provided
* Browser Support (using Webpack/Browserify)
* Full test coverage

**Requirements**:
* Node v4.0+ is supported at this time.  (Versions prior to 2.0 will work on node 0.10)



## Breaking Changes in v4.0

* Old constructor patterns have been completely removed. It's now required to use the SmartBuffer.fromXXX() factory constructors.
* rewind(), skip(), moveTo() have been removed. (see [offsets](#offsets))
* Internal private properties are now prefixed with underscores (_)
* **All** writeXXX() methods that are given an offset will now **overwrite data** instead of insert. (see [write vs insert](#write-vs-insert))
* insertXXX() methods have been added for when you want to insert data at a specific offset (this replaces the old behavior of writeXXX() when an offset was provided)


## Looking for v3 docs?

Legacy documentation for version 3 and prior can be found [here](https://github.com/JoshGlazebrook/smart-buffer/blob/master/docs/README_v3.md).

## Installing:

`yarn add smart-buffer`

or

`npm install smart-buffer`

Note: The published NPM package includes the built javascript library.
If you cloned this repo and wish to build the library manually use:

`npm run build`

## Using smart-buffer

```javascript
// Javascript
const SmartBuffer = require('smart-buffer').SmartBuffer;

// Typescript
import { SmartBuffer, SmartBufferOptions} from 'smart-buffer';
```

### Simple Example

Building a packet that uses the following protocol specification:

`[PacketType:2][PacketLength:2][Data:XX]`

To build this packet using the vanilla Buffer class, you would have to count up the length of the data payload beforehand. You would also nee
