        How can I build with HTML and CSS
    </h1>
    <P>
        HTML and CSS are the foundation of websites in that they provide structure and styling to a web page.
        With HTML you can add non-interactive elements such as text and images,and include interactive elements
        such as links,button and videos.
    </P>
    <p>
        With CSS, you can style web pages. You can also make websites responsive using CSS.This is possible with media queries, 
        which were introduce in CSS3. <br />
        (HTML is on its fifth iteration,so you'll see it reffered to as HTNL5, why CSS is on its third-aka CSS3)
    </p>

    <P>
        Since the addition of media queries, its possible to check the width and height of the current device,
         as well as the orientation (landscape or portrait). That means you can make a site mobile responsive using just HTML and CSS.
    </P>
    <P>
        It IS possible to create animations using CSS by gradually changing an elements properties. And you can even create
         flashy scrolling effects (known as “parallax(opens in a new tab)“) with CSS.
    </P>
    <P>
        While working on HTML and CSS projects can help you build beautiful websites, for more complex sites, you would most likely
         want to use JavaScript. With JavaScript, you can fetch data from a database, handle different states of an application, and
          easily add interactive elements like a slider.

        That said, there is still a LOT you can do with HTML and CSS alone. Lets take a look at some great project ideas to try out.

        3. CREATE AN EMAIL NEWSLETTER
    </h3>
    <p>
        There are job opportunities focused on email building that require HTML and CSS knowledge. You can use an email newsletter
         service like MailChimp and customize the designs. <br /> <br />

        <u>Here are some ideas on what emails to create for practice:</u> <br />
        <ul>

        4. MAKE A STATIC RESPONSIVE WEBSITE
    </h3>
    <p>
        Users come to websites from various devices. This means they are viewing the content on different screen sizes.
         A responsive website has content formatted according to screen size using CSS media queries and HTML. It is important to 
         know how to do this, so take that personal website, portfolio, or mock site and make it work across all different viewport sizes. <br />
         <u>Here are some ideas of what websites to make for practice</u> <br />
         <ul>
             <li>A web page for a make-believe restaurant</li>
             <li>A biographical page about your favorite author</li>
             <li>Offer your services to a restaurant looking to have an online presence with a static website and menu pages</li>
             </ul>
         This is also an opportunity to learn Flexbox(opens in a new tab) to build a grid system that easily collapses based on the screen size.
    </p>
    <h3>
        5. BUILD A FORM 
    </h3>
    <p>
        Knowing how to put interactive controls together to build a form is extremely useful in web development. You use buttons, inputs,
         forms, and HTML elements to allow for user input. This is also a chance to show your UX and UI skills by making the form accessible,
          making decisions about placeholder helper text, and creating labels for form fields.
    </p>
    <h3>
        6. CREATE AN ANIMATION 
    </h3>

        An animation? With just HTML and CSS? Yup, it is possible! You can put your CSS skills to the test by creating shapes and animations to 
        break down data or to make your website feel more interactive. For example, you can use an animation when a user hovers over an element. <br />
        Here are some ideas for animations to create: <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Hover interactions for your personal site to let the user know where they are</li>
            <li>An animation to greet your users</li>
            </ul>
    </P>

         real world experience while honing your skills.
